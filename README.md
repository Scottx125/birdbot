# birdbot

For the BirdbotStarter, it needs admin permissions. You can either run it as admin every time you start the bot OR. Go into the files properties, go to security - advanced, go to 'Disable inheritance' and click 'Remove all inherited permissions'. Then click 'Add'/'select a principal' and in the text box type the name of the current user on the PC (you). Then click 'Check names' and your user name should appear, click 'ok'. Now you should be able to add permissions, the easiest way to do this is just to click 'Full control' and hit 'ok'. 

Once done you should see only one user with access, when you're happy with the changes you've made click 'Apply' and then 'ok'. Now the file and all inherited files should be able to run with admin without the need to constantly approve permission.
